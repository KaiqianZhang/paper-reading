## Main idea

- decompose protein into three independent "protein sectors"

- based sequence conservation; correlations of sequence positions

- model system used: S1A family

- four charactersitics of "protein sectors":

    * statistical independence
    
    * physical connectivity in the tertiary structure
    
    * biochemical independence in mediating protein function
    
    * independent phenotypic variation in the protein family
