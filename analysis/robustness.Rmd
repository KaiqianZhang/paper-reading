## Research question

- whether cell network is sensitive or robust to variations in their biochemical parameters.

## Mechanism

- a biochemical network responsible for bacterial chemotaxis

- input: ligand concentration

- output: tumbling frequency

- a two-state model

- input: ligand concentration `l`

- output: average complex activity `A`

## Conclusion

- cell network is robust. 

## Findings

- Fig 2: When a typical model system is subject to a step-like change in attractant concentration, it is able to respond and to adapt to the imposed change. The adaptation is nearly perfect for all ligand concetrations.

- Fig 3b: Robustness is thus a characteristic of specific network properties and not of the network as a whole: whereas some properties are robust, others can show sensitivity to changes in the network parameters, e.g. adaptation time, steady-state tumbling frequency.

- These non-robust properties of the network show a strong correlation in their variation.

- Adaptation property is observed in a large variety of populations.

- Adaptation property is preserved even if two genetically identical bateria have various non-robust properties in the network (such as adaptation time, steady-state tumbling frequency). 

## Activity dependent kinetics

- idea: Activity = active modified enzyme + active unmodified enzyme. Imagine a feed-back system, in which the output A determines the rates of modification reactions, which in turn determine the slow changes in A. 
- with activity-dependent kinetics, the adaptation properties is insensitive to the values of system parameters (such as enzyme concentrations). 

- but the steady-state activity depends on the enzyme concentration
