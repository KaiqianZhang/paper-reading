## Problem

To estimate evolutionary trees from sequences.


## Methods

- Iteratively find the optimum tree topology. 

- Given a tree topology, find the maximum tree by finding optimum segment length, iteratively.

- Given a tree, compute likelihood of a tree (likelihood of data given the tree).
    
    * Compute substitution probability $P_{ij}$ (probablity of changing base from $i$ to $j$)
    
    * Pulley principle: we could regard any unrooted tree as containing the root.
    
    
## Limitation

- Not allow for deletion and insertion.

- Constraints on amino acid substitution.
