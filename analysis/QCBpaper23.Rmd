- Estimated reading time: 3.5 - 4 hrs

- Caveat: It has too many equations and do not get the chance to derive most of them. 

- Goal: To establish the relation between threshold fluctuations and electrical noise. 

- Method: Uses two-variable description of threshold fluctuations: $V\sigma$ approximation.
