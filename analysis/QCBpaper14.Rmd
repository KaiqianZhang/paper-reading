## Problem

* Given two long sequences, we want to find a pair of segments with largest similarity (homology). The method also allows for arbitrary length deletions and insertions.

## Youtube lecture

* Please refer to the lecture that illustrates [`Needleman-Wunsch-Sellers` algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdyARRNwi7I&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63uK-oWiLgO7LLJV6ZCWXac&index=3) from 45:00 to 1:02:17.
