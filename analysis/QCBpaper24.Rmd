## Keypoint

- Contrast response functions (CRFs) describe how a neuron’s firing rate depends on the contrast, or intensity, of a visual stimulus.  x-axis is contrast and y-axis is response. Shape of this function: sigmoid. 

- Goal: want to code the response states

- Solution: use cumulative probablity distribution of contrast.

- Verify experiment target: first order interneurons of the blowfly’s compound eye.

- And show that: The light adapted contrast-response function approximates to the sigmoidal form of the cumulative  probability function for contrast levels in natural scenes,
