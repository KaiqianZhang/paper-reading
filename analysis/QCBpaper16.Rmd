## Keywords

- Genome analysis, clustering

## Method

- adopt a mathematical description for gene expression similarity: standard correlation coefficient (i.e the dot prodoct of two normalized vectors???)

    - formula under section `Metrics`. Note that $G_{\text{offset}}$ is not the mean of observations, and set to $0$.

- unsupervised learning: pairwise average-linkage cluster analysis.

    - gene: tree; similarity: length of branch
    
    - given correlation matrix of gene expression
    
    - identify the highest value, which leads to the most similar pair of genes
    
    - a node is created for joining these two genes, then this node replace these two genes by using a mean value of two
    
    - repeat the process
