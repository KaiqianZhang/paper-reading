## Goal

This study aimed to examine whether protein expression levels evolve towards optimal solutions of a cost-benefit problem.

## Details

- experiment condition: constnat lactose environment

### Experiment 1

- measure cost and benefit of Lac protein expression in wild-type E. coli.

#### Cost

- define cost: reduction in growth rate due to cell production and presence of Lac protein burden

- measure cost: no lactose; at various concentration of inducer IPTG; 

- finding: the cost per protein increases as more Lac protein is produced.

#### Benefit

- define benefit: gained by the action of the Lac proteins that transport and use lactose

- measure benefit: at various concentration of lactose; full induction with saturating IPTG (to keep cost constant)

### Experiment 2

- Over generations, would E. coli actually evolve to these optimal expression levels under a constant lactose environment?

#### findings

- changes in LacZ activity were proportional to changes in LacZ protein level.
